# Python Docs (Condensed)

## Why
### Issue
- Main Pythod documentation index page has A LOT of headings
and isn't collapsible
- Python sub-pages don't show full index trees

### Solution

Links to the top-level pages from the index I care about so I don't have
to touch the index often, with index-accurate names so I can look them up
quickly in the index if I want to see the sub-trees
